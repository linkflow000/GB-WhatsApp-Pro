        GB WhatsApp is a popular modified version of the original WhatsApp, offering users advanced features that are not available in the official app. 
        With GB WhatsApp, you can customize your interface, hide your online status, send larger files, and even use multiple accounts on the same device. 
        Itâ€™s perfect for those who want more control over their messaging experience and enjoy additional privacy options.
